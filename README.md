# Password-Generator

This project is a desktop-based password generator application developed using Python and Tkinter. The main objective of the project is to help users generate strong and secure random passwords easily through a simple graphical user interface.

The application provides a clean window containing a title label, a password display field, and a button to generate passwords. When the user clicks the “Generate Password” button, the program creates a 28-character random password using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The generated password is instantly displayed in the input field for easy copying and use.

The project follows an object-oriented approach, where the GUI layout and functionality are organized inside a class. This improves code readability, reusability, and maintainability. Overall, the application demonstrates the practical use of Tkinter for GUI development, randomization for security, and Python string handling, making it a useful beginner-to-intermediate level project.
